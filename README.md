# 🌿 Crop Disease Detection System

An AI-powered web application that detects crop diseases from leaf images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
The system provides disease predictions, confidence scores, severity levels, and recommended remedies.  
It also allows users to download reports in **PDF** and **JSON** formats.

## 📊 Severity Levels
Severity is calculated based on prediction confidence:

| Confidence | Severity |
|-----------|---------|
| < 60% | Low |
| 60–85% | Medium |
| > 85% | High |
| Healthy class | Healthy |
